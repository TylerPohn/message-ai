## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Start with Feature 1**
   - Lowest risk, highest impact
   - Builds on existing translation

   - Test on iOS & Android
   - Test on slow network
   - Test offline

4. **Cache aggressively**
   - Same message shouldn't retranslate
   - Save API calls = save money
   - Improve performance
   - Check TTL values in code

5. **Monitor API costs**
   - Budget ~$30/active user/month
   - Monitor OpenAI dashboard
   - Batch requests when possible
   - Optimize prompts

6. **Collect user feedback**
   - Show beta users early
   - Ask: Is this helpful?
   - Iterate based on feedback
   - Make it amazing
