## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start with Feature 1**
   - Lowest risk, highest impact
   - Builds on existing translation
   - 2-3 days to working feature

2. **Deploy frequently**
   - Don't wait for "perfect"
   - Deploy after each feature
   - Get feedback early

3. **Cache aggressively**
   - Same message shouldn't retranslate
   - Save API calls & money
   - Improve performance

4. **Test on real devices**
   - Emulator != real device
   - Test iOS, Android, slow network, offline

5. **Monitor API costs**
   - Budget ~$30/active user/month
   - Monitor OpenAI dashboard
   - Optimize prompts
