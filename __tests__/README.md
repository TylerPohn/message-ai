# Translation Service Tests

## Overview

These tests verify that the translation services correctly handle the data structure transformation from N8N's nested response format to React's expected flat format with `translatedText` as a string.

## The Problem These Tests Prevent

Previously, N8N returned translations with this structure:
```javascript
{
  translatedText: {
    content: {
      translated_text: "Toca césped",
      cultural_context: {...},
      formality: {...},
      idioms: [...]
    }
  }
}
```

When this was passed directly to React's `<Text>` component, it caused:
```
ERROR: Objects are not valid as a React child
```

## The Solution

The services now extract the data correctly:
```javascript
{
  translatedText: "Toca césped",  // ← String for React rendering
  culturalContext: {...},          // ← Separate top-level property
  formality: {...},                // ← Separate top-level property
  idioms: [...]                    // ← Separate top-level property
}
```

## Test Files

### `translateService.test.ts`
Tests the N8N response parsing logic:
- ✅ Extracts `translatedText` as a string (not an object)
- ✅ Extracts AI features from nested structure
- ✅ Handles flat responses (backwards compatibility)
- ✅ Produces React-safe output structure
- ✅ Handles missing AI features gracefully

### `translationStorageService.test.ts`
Tests the Firebase storage structure:
- ✅ Stores `translatedText` as a string
- ✅ Stores AI features as separate top-level properties
- ✅ Matches the `Translation` interface from `types/messaging.ts`
- ✅ Handles translations without AI features
- ✅ Prevents accidental nesting

### `translation-integration.test.ts`
Tests the complete end-to-end flow:
- ✅ Parses real Firebase data that caused the bug
- ✅ Verifies AI features are accessible in metadata modal
- ✅ Compares old (buggy) vs new (fixed) structure
- ✅ Simulates complete chat message rendering flow
- ✅ Verifies metadata modal can access AI features

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run individual test suites
npm run test:translate      # translateService tests
npm run test:storage        # translationStorageService tests
npm run test:integration    # End-to-end integration tests
```

## Test Results

All 15 tests pass:
- ✅ 5 translateService tests
- ✅ 5 translationStorageService tests
- ✅ 5 integration tests

## What These Tests Verify

1. **Type Safety**: `translatedText` is always a `string`, never an `object`
2. **React Compatibility**: The structure is safe for React to render
3. **Data Integrity**: AI features are preserved and accessible
4. **Backwards Compatibility**: Handles both nested and flat N8N responses
5. **End-to-End Flow**: Complete journey from N8N → Storage → React rendering

## Adding New Tests

To add a new test:

```typescript
import { TestRunner, TestAssertion } from './setup'

const runner = new TestRunner()

runner.test('Your test name', () => {
  // Your test code
  TestAssertion.assertEquals(actual, expected, 'message')
  TestAssertion.assertType(value, 'string', 'message')
  TestAssertion.assertTrue(condition, 'message')
  TestAssertion.assertNotNull(value, 'message')
})

runner.run()
```

## Key Assertions

- `translatedText` must be `typeof === 'string'`
- `translatedText` must NOT have nested properties like `cultural_context`
- AI features must be at the top level of the translation object
- The structure must match the `Translation` interface in `types/messaging.ts`

## Files Modified to Fix the Bug

1. `services/translateService.ts:371-404` - Added nested structure parsing
2. `app/chat/[id].tsx:848-861` - Simplified text extraction (now trusts the structure)
3. `services/translationStorageService.ts` - Already correct (verified by tests)
