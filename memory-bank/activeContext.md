## Active Decisions and Considerations

- **State Management**: React Query for server state, considering Zustand for client state
- **UI Framework**: Expo Router for navigation, FlashList for performance
- **AI Integration**: Vercel AI SDK or LangChain for LLM integration

## Current Blockers

- None identified

## Immediate Priorities

1. Complete memory bank structure setup
2. Update memory bank rules to reflect new workflow
3. Begin core messaging infrastructure development
4. Implement basic chat screens and real-time functionality
